### **Plan: Device Discovery, Selection, and Connection**

Here is the proposed plan to implement the requested features.

#### **1. High-Level Goal**

The goal is to transform the application from simply detecting that devices are present to providing an interactive list of discovered USB devices. The user will be able to select a device from this list and initiate a connection to it. The UI will be updated to reflect the current connection status.

#### **2. Architectural Changes**

The changes will be focused primarily within `MainActivity.kt` to manage the UI state and connection logic. The current approach of dynamically registering a `BroadcastReceiver` is appropriate and will be enhanced to handle the connection flow.

#### **3. Detailed Implementation Plan**

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the required changes:

**Step 1: Enhance UI State Management in `MainActivity.kt`**

To create a more dynamic and interactive UI, several `MutableState` variables will be introduced to hold the list of devices, the currently selected device, and the connection status.

*   **Discovered Devices:** A state variable will hold the list of discovered USB devices to be displayed in the UI.
    ```kotlin
    val discoveredDevices = remember { mutableStateOf<List<UsbDevice>>(emptyList()) }
    ```
*   **Connection Status:** A state variable will track and display the current connection status (e.g., "Disconnected", "Connecting...", "Connected", "Error").
    ```kotlin
    val connectionStatus = remember { mutableStateOf("Disconnected") }
    ```
*   **USB Serial Port:** A state variable will hold the active `UsbSerialPort` instance once a connection is established.
    ```kotlin
    var usbSerialPort: UsbSerialPort? by remember { mutableStateOf(null) }
    ```

**Step 2: Update the Jetpack Compose UI in `MainActivity.kt`**

The UI will be updated to display the list of discovered devices and allow user interaction.

*   **Device List:** The simple `Text` view will be replaced with a `LazyColumn` to display each discovered device.
*   **Clickable Items:** Each item in the `LazyColumn` will be a clickable row containing the device's name (`device.deviceName`) and a "Connect" button.
*   **Connection Logic Trigger:** Clicking the "Connect" button for a specific device will trigger the connection logic for that device.
*   **Status Display:** A `Text` element will be bound to the `connectionStatus` state variable to show real-time feedback to the user.

**Step 3: Refine Device Discovery and Connection Logic in `MainActivity.kt`**

The core logic for discovery and connection will be updated to work with the new state management and UI.

*   **`discoverUsbDevices()`:** This function will be modified to update the `discoveredDevices` state variable with a `List<UsbDevice>` instead of returning a formatted string.
*   **`connectToDevice(device: UsbDevice)`:** This new function will be created and called when the user clicks a "Connect" button. It will:
    1.  Request permission to access the USB device.
    2.  Upon receiving permission, find the correct `UsbSerialDriver`.
    3.  Open a connection to the device's `UsbSerialPort`.
    4.  Configure the serial port parameters (e.g., baud rate, data bits).
    5.  Update the `connectionStatus` and `usbSerialPort` state variables.
*   **`disconnectDevice()`:** A function will be added to properly close the `usbSerialPort` and update the connection status. This will be triggered by a "Disconnect" button that appears when a device is connected.

**Step 4: Implement a Robust `BroadcastReceiver`**

To handle the asynchronous nature of USB permission requests, a more robust `BroadcastReceiver` will be implemented.

*   **Dynamic Registration:** The receiver will be registered in the activity's `onResume()` method and unregistered in `onPause()` to align with the activity's lifecycle.
*   **Permission Handling:** The receiver will listen for the `ACTION_USB_PERMISSION` intent. If permission is granted, it will proceed with the connection logic. If denied, it will update the `connectionStatus` to inform the user.
